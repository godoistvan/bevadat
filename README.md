This is my first datascience project after a couple of weeks of learning it in UNI the dataset is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/suicides-risk-factors/data
The first section of the code belongs to https://www.kaggle.com/code/stpeteishii/world-map-on-suicide-rate although i did some alternations so it fits my project better
